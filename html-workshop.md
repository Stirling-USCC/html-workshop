# Introduction

## How Web Pages Work

The internet and its world-wide web has had a profound impact on all of our lives. It has put an unimagineably large
wealth of [mis]information at our fingertips, connected us to people on the other side of  the plannet, and
fundamentally changed how day-to-day business is conducted in the 21st century. But have you ever stopped to think about
how your browser is able to show you a complex, feature rich, and eye-catching page, seemingly out of the
ether?

### 1. Browser Requests Page

First, the browser looks up and connects to the server you're trying to access. It then asks the server for the specific
page you're trying to load, using the [HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)][http], which is a specification of how the
messages between the web-browser and the web-server are structured. We'll be covering the HTTP protocol in much more
detail in a [later workshop][http-workshop].

## Web Server Sends Response

The web-server then responds with instructions on how to build the page. There instructions are written in HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript, and these are the three technologies we will be teaching you how to write today.
