We use a CodePen website that attendees will be asked to work on (local copies of)

The initial file contains a body with header and footer

Then html/css elements are introduced in the following sequence:
    - A basic hello world site introduces the `p` tag
    - A few verses of a poem explores the `p` tag in depth along with `br`
    - We add a menu option, introducing `ul`, `li`, `a`
    - A footer, introducing the `footer` tag
    - Introduce structuring content with `div` tags
    - Start adding CSS
    - TODO
